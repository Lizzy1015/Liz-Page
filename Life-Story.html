<h1> Liz's Life </h1>
<p> I like to draw anime and write short stories. As of right now, I am a sophmore and I respect my teachers a lot. I hope to become an accountant or a teacher in my future, but at the moment I am uncertain of which college I will attend. In my own time, I enjoy animating and creating new characters. Also, I excell in my work for school as I am very commited to everything I do. </p>
